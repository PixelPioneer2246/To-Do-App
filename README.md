âœ… To-Do App Summary
I created a To-Do List web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to:

Add new tasks using an input box and a button.

Mark tasks as complete by clicking on them (toggle check style).

Delete tasks by clicking a âœ– (cross) button.

Save tasks in the browser's localStorage, so they stay even after refreshing the page.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
HTML for structure (input box, button, and task list).

CSS for basic styling (optional: for checked tasks and layout).

JavaScript for interactivity:

DOM manipulation to add/remove tasks.

localStorage to save and load data automatically.
